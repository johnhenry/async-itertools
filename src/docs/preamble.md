# Async-itertools

This module implements a number of asynchronous iterator building blocks inspired by constructs from [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html), APL, Haskell, and SML. Each has been recast in a form suitable for JavaScript.

The module standardizes a core set of fast, memory efficient tools that are useful by themselves or in combination. Together, they form an “iterator algebra” making it possible to construct specialized tools succinctly and efficiently in pure JavaScript.
